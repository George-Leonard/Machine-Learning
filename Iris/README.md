This is a classifier for the iris dataset which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris or can be accessed via scikit learn's prebuilt datasets import (from sklearn.datasets import load_iris) I used KNN as a default for this as it is the one im most comfortable with as its simple and gives good results for these types of datasets. NOTE: Feel free to edit or use this in whichever way you wish.
