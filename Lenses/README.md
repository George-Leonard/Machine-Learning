This is a classifier for the dataset for lenses, which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lenses. NOTE: I understand i could've used other methods like a svm, but i was experimenting with KNN's at the time. Please feel free to use this code or extend it.

The lenses.txt file is a file which contains data with lense type on each row. These are 1, 2 and 3 corresponding to the following classes.

3 Classes

- 1 : the patient should be fitted with hard contact lenses,
- 2 : the patient should be fitted with soft contact lenses,
- 3 : the patient should not be fitted with contact lenses.
